    "# Starting Math Education Over\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've had a normal mathematics education, you may have been led to believe that mathematics starts with numbers and progressively adds complexity over them(statistics, calculus, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our goals in this bootcamp is to have you be able to read research papers without skipping over the math sections. We don't need you to be able to write new math, but you shouldn't be scared of reading math when you come across it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are problems with the approach to mathematics taught in school. \n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers are already a fairly complicated mathematical object. We skip over lots of relevant parts to start math education with numbers. This makes people feel like mathematics is a scary, unknowable field researved for priviledged elites. Moreover, because we skip over so much of the math, we never develop the  comfort with mathematics in general and instead focus on specific aspects (like doing long divisions or calculus by hand) which aren't particularly useful in the larger context of \"understanding math\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) (the numbers we count things with) are not just a \"simplified version\" of the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) (which are used to do most math). \n",
    "\n",
    "While you can always multiply two natural numbers and get back a natural number. But we can't do the same for division: some say things like \"23 is not divisible by 5\" which is true in the sense that you would escape out of the whole numbers and into fractional numbers if you went ahead with that division.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun Fact:** This is why lots of household items come in packs of 12. You can divide 12 by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 -- 12 is almost perfectly divisible. This makes 12 a handy number for things you might have to divide in whole quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural numbers and real numbers are examples of **sets**. The set is the most basic mathematical object -- all mathematics is derived up from sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** A good book to have around is [A Programmer's introduction to Mathematics](https://gumroad.com/l/pim-book) which is free (but please tip the author!). If you want to dive deeper into this topic, it's covered in **Chapter 4** as well as **Chapter 1** or [\"Introductory Real Analysis\"](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Analysis-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486612260) by Kolmogorov\n",
    "\n",
    "With this said, let's start:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Set** is a collection of **unique** (eg. not repeated) objects."
